Greenbase is a theme for ProjectPier, which is an Open Source project management and collaboration
tool that you can install on your own server (http://www.projectpier.org). 

Greenbase tries to follow these guidelines:
- put user content at the front, by using larger/darker fonts for its content, smaller/dimmer fonts for administrative info
- only show action links on hover, so the user-generated content is easier to parse
- use color extremely sparingly
- use distinctive look for human names throughout the interface
- encourage a unique navigation path through the app, by hiding bits of the interface (e.g. the userbox dropdowns)
- try to make each page focused on a single issue, hide bits of the interface that don't follow this (e.g. milestones on "my tasks" page)

Greenbase is based on redbase.

Here is a list of the few things that have been hidden from the interface:
- dropdown links in the userbox (top right of every page)
- header on the overview page
- action links on the overview page (following the idea that to create e.g. a milestone, you should go to the milestone page)
- action links on the "my tasks" page (these would not allow you to create a new task)
- probably a lot more
If you can't find a usual element of ProjectPier, there's a good chance it was removed on purpose.
